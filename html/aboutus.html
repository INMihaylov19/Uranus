                in advance. Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that! But who's going to fly it, kid!
                You?</p>

            <p>Have you been in many battles? Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more
                than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting,
